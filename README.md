# PYQB
PYQB is an interpreter written in Python for the (Q)BASIC Language. I don't really expect to create a program using which you can run already written QB code with a single command. The goal of this project has been to allow me to learn more about interpreting as well as to allow me to gain familiarity with the task of generating lexers and making parsers. I hope that the code that I have authored has ample comments so as to not leave you astray.
